# Software Engineering Individual Project: SquarePush

This project implements the solitaire game SquarePush in React.js using the Entity, Boundary, and Controller design pattern.
The character NinjaSe (represented by a green 2x2 square) moves around an N by N board. The goal is to push colored tiles to form a 2x2 square of the same color and then remove it. Once all colors are removed, the game is won.
